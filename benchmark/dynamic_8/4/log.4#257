20871.4 <c-4#257:1> DynamicCubeGeneratorThread 42: resume because there are no longer too many cubes
20871.4 <c-4#257:1> DynamicCubeGeneratorThread 42: entered cube retrieval loop
20871.4 <c-4#257:1> DynamicCubeGeneratorThread 42: did not get a cube because the lib is interrupted
20871.4 <c-4#257:1> DynamicCubeGeneratorThread 42: Skipped generating, because no cube is available
